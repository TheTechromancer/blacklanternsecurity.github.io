For many organizations out there, the first time they get to see whether or not those expensive network security appliances or endpoint solutions work as promised is when they are under direct attack from a real-world adversary; much the same can be said for the incident handling process itself. We all know that no matter how good our gear is we never want to field our teams and play for the championship without having practiced our playbooks 100s of times before! Information Security Programs should be approached in exactly the same way. We need to give our defenders multiple and if not continuous opportunities to implement and execute the defensive playbook. This is the BLS “Attack to Defend” mindset. That is, the fundamental objective of a Red Team Engagement or Penetration test is to provide for a better defense. We exist for the explicit purpose of improving and empowering network defenders, protecting organizations, and reducing overall risk.

In planning for the penetration test, BLS Engineers are going examine the threats and vulnerabilities that are most relevant to the business. For test execution, the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) utilized by the penetration tester will provide validated and relevant threats and attempt to demonstrate the greatest potential to negatively impact near and/or long term business operations. Our resulting analysis and recommendations are designed to empower the business and defend those critical business resources that add to the bottom line every day.

Our Penetration Testing methodology is based on industry accepted standards, including NIST SP800-115 and the Penetration Testing and Execution Standard (PTES).


### Penetration test activities include:

## Planning, Scope, and Customer On-Boarding
Looks at structured and unstructured testing of network, application, and host based security controls
Considers the maturity of the information security program, business objectives, resources, and overall mission
Establishes test scope and blacklisted systems
States test objectives and overall goals
Establishes test duration and rules of engagement (ROE)
Passive Information Gathering
Considers how the business makes money
Identifies critical resources (Point of Sale (PoS) systems, Databases, Enterprise Applications, Intellectual Property, PII, PHI)
Identifies key personnel (Comptroller(s), C-level Executives, System/Network administrators)
Analyzes digital footprint (IP space, domain(s), hosts, mail server)
Analyzes physical footprint (physical addresses, adjacent businesses, tenants)
Investigates social media presence
Identifies partner organizations
Researches technologies deployed
Active Information Gathering
Identifies public facing systems and services, including web sites and applications
Identifies remote access solutions
Executes vulnerability scanning
Identifies security controls deployed
Attack Planning and Execution
Identifies vulnerabilities and/or misconfigurations to be attacked
Identifies desired “mission effects” (impacts to business processes, exfiltration of PII/PHI/cardholder info, disruption/denial of service)
Establishes mission thread from initial compromise to data exfiltration and clean-up
Configuration of tools, utilities, and/or custom exploitation techniques
Verifies security controls being tested and expected results
Attack execution
Post Exploitation Activities
Establish persistent user-level access
Escalate privileges
Move laterally to additional systems and workstations
Create specific mission effects and demonstrate business impacts
Reporting and Mitigation Strategy
Includes test timeline and description of activities
Provides detailed mitigation steps and strategies that are vendor agnostic and can be implemented by existing personnel
Identifies perceived and actual gaps and provides concrete steps for improvement
This is not the byproduct of an automated tool
