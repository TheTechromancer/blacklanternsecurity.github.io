For many organizations out there, the first time they get to see whether or not those expensive network security appliances or endpoint solutions work as promised is when they are under direct attack from a real-world adversary; much the same can be said for the incident handling process itself. No matter how good our gear is we never want to field our teams and play for the championship without having practiced our playbooks 100s of times before! Information Security Programs should be approached in exactly the same way. We need to give our defenders multiple if not continuous opportunities to implement and execute the defensive playbook. This is the BLS “Attack to Defend” mindset. That is, the fundamental objective of a Red Team Engagement or Penetration test is to provide for a better defense. We exist for the explicit purpose of improving and empowering network defenders, protecting the organization, and reducing overall risk.

**Types of Testing:**

* External Network Penetration Testing
* Internal (On-Site) Network Penetration Testing
* Wireless Penetration Testing
* Web Application Penetration Testing
* Red Teaming

Most vulnerability assessments and scanners will leverage publicly available information to identify well-known vulnerabilities and common misconfigurations.  This information provides the basis for a solid mitigation strategy and is the first step to securing critical resources.  However, for organizations facing a determined and well-resourced adversary this may not be enough.  BLS engineers will conduct exploratory research and analysis of complex systems for the express purpose of discovering new and/or undisclosed vulnerabilities.  The objective is to discover these vulnerabilities and take corrective action before they can be exploited by an attacker.
